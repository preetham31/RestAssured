## 🧪 Description

This repository contains automated test cases for the Swift application. Tests cover:

- All major REST endpoints (login, authentication, data retrieval, etc.)
- Validation of status codes, response schema, headers, error handling
- Positive & negative test scenarios
- Authenticated routes and sessions when applicable

Swagger / API documentation helps understand the endpoints, request/response models, params etc. The tests leverage that to build requests and verify responses.
